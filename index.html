              The English Premier League or the EPL is the highest competitive football league in the United Kingdom.
              The league was established in the year 1992. The competition consists of 20 football teams hailing from either England or Wales.
              All teams compete in a 38 game season in which they play each team twice, once at their home ground and the other away.
              At the end of the season, the teams that finish in the 18th to 20th positions are all relegated or demoted to the Championship; the league below the Premier League.
